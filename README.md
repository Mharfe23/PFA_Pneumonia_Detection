This project is part of the digital transformation of the healthcare sector, aiming to develop automated diagnostic tools capable of supporting healthcare professionals in their clinical decisions.
By using pre-trained CNN models such as VGG16 and InceptionV3, as well as a custom CNN model, we analyzed and compared their performance in terms of accuracy, loss, and confusion matrices. Additionally, we integrated the classification model into a web application developed with the Flask framework. 
This application allows users to upload X-ray images and instantly receive a preliminary diagnosis, along with recommendations to consult a specialist doctor.
